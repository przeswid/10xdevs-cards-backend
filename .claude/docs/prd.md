# Product Requirements Document (PRD) – 10x-cards

## 1. Product Overview
The 10x-cards project aims to enable users to quickly create and manage educational flashcard sets. The application uses LLM models (via API) to generate flashcard suggestions based on provided text.

## 2. User Problem
Manual creation of high-quality flashcards requires significant time and effort investment, which discourages the use of spaced repetition - an effective learning method. The solution aims to reduce the time needed to create appropriate questions and answers and simplify the process of managing study material.

## 3. Functional Requirements
1. Automatic flashcard generation:
    - User pastes any text (e.g., textbook excerpt).
    - Application sends text to LLM model via API.
    - LLM model suggests a set of flashcards (questions and answers).
    - Flashcards are presented to the user as a list with options to accept, edit, or reject.

2. Manual flashcard creation and management:
    - Form for manually creating flashcards (front and back of card).
    - Options to edit and delete existing flashcards.
    - Manual creation and display within "My flashcards" list view.

3. Basic authentication and user account system:
    - Registration and login.
    - Ability to delete account and associated flashcards upon request.

4. Integration with repetition algorithm:
    - Provide mechanism for assigning flashcards to repetition schedule (using existing algorithm).
    - No additional metadata and advanced notification features in MVP.

5. Storage and scalability:
    - Flashcard and user data stored in a way that ensures scalability and security.

6. Flashcard generation statistics:
    - Collecting information about how many flashcards were generated by AI and how many were ultimately accepted.

7. Legal requirements and constraints:
    - User personal data and flashcards stored in compliance with GDPR.
    - Right to access and delete data (account with flashcards) upon user request.

## 4. Product Boundaries
1. Out of scope for MVP:
    - Advanced, proprietary repetition algorithm (we use existing solution, open-source library).
    - Gamification mechanisms.
    - Mobile applications (currently web version only).
    - Import of multiple document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
    - Publicly available API.
    - Sharing flashcards between users.
    - Advanced notification system.
    - Advanced flashcard search by keywords.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The flashcard generation view contains a text field where user can paste their text.
- Text field expects 1000 to 10,000 characters.
- After clicking the generation button, application communicates with LLM model API and displays a list of generated flashcard suggestions for user approval.
- In case of API problems or no model response, user will see an appropriate error message.

ID: US-004
Title: Review and approve flashcard suggestions
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to be able to review generated flashcards and decide which ones I want to add to my set, to keep only useful questions and answers.
Acceptance Criteria:
- List of generated flashcards is displayed below the generation form.
- Each flashcard has a button allowing approval, editing, or rejection.
- After approving selected flashcards, user can click save button and add them to database.

ID: US-005
Title: Edit manually created and AI-generated flashcards
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to edit created or generated flashcards to correct any errors or adjust questions and answers to my own needs.
Acceptance Criteria:
- There is a list of saved flashcards (both manually created and approved generated ones).
- Each flashcard can be clicked to enter edit mode.
- Changes are saved to database after confirmation.

ID: US-006
Title: Delete flashcards
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to delete unnecessary flashcards to maintain order in my set.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Each flashcard in the list (in "My flashcards" view) has a visible delete option.
- After selecting delete, user must confirm the operation before the flashcard is permanently deleted.
- Flashcards are permanently deleted from database after confirmation.

ID: US-007
Title: Manual flashcard creation
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to manually create a flashcard (defining front and back of card) to add my own material that doesn't come from automatically generated content.
Acceptance Criteria:
- "My flashcards" view contains an add new flashcard button.
- Clicking the button opens a form with "Front" and "Back" fields.
- After saving, new flashcard appears in the list.

ID: US-008
Title: Study session with repetition algorithm
Description: As a logged-in user, I want added flashcards to be available in "Study session" view based on external algorithm, so I can study effectively (spaced repetition).
Acceptance Criteria:
- In "Study session" view, algorithm prepares a study session of flashcards for me.
- At start, front of flashcard is displayed, through interaction user displays its back.
- User rates according to algorithm expectations how well they learned the flashcard.
- Then algorithm shows next flashcard within the study session.

ID: US-009
Title: Secure access and authorization
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to be sure that my flashcards are not accessible to other users, to maintain privacy and data security.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Only logged-in user can view, edit, and delete their flashcards.
- No access to other users' flashcards or sharing capability.

## 6. Success Metrics
1. Flashcard generation efficiency:
    - 75% of AI-generated flashcards are accepted by users.
    - Users create at least 75% of flashcards using AI (relative to all newly added flashcards).
3. Engagement:
