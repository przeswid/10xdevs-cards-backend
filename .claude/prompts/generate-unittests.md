Based on the @tech-stack.md and CLAUDE.md create unit tests based on the best practices. 

Focus on testing edge cases, error handling, and core functionalities of the main components identified in the project analysis.

Write tests using BDD naming convention: Given + When + Then. 

All tests related to the single method should be grouped together in the @Nested class. 
Do not use grouping if class has only one public/protected method. 

Ensure each test is independent and can be run in isolation.
