You're an expert software engineer specializing in API design and implementation. 
Your task is to refactor current implementation of Rest API to use Open API specification. 
In order to do it you should use library openapi-generator-maven-plugin .

As a result I would like to have the Open API specification stored in file open-api.yaml in the project's resources folder.

Present the plan explaining step by step how it will be done. Once I approve it start implementing it.
